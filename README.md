# Romeo-Juliet_Card-Game
Play
Red moves first and each plays in turn. At each turn you either move your Romeo or swap two cards in the layout, in accordance with the rules below.
Moving your Romeo

On your opening move you move Romeo like a chess king to any one of the three adjacent cards. 
Thereafter:
From a red numeral you move vertically, up or down as preferred, the number of cards indicated by the numeral you are on (counting ace as one and others at face value);
From a black numeral you move horizontally, left or right as preferred, the number of cards indicated by the card you are on.
If your move takes you beyond the edge of the board you pass immediately to the first card at the opposite end of the same row or column and continue in the same directionnote 
    1. You may not land on or jump over your opponent's Romeonote
    2, nor may you land again on the Queen you started from.
From a King, you move like a chess king, one step to any one of up to eight immediately surrounding cards, except that you may not make a move that would take you over an edge.
From a Jack, you move like a chess knight to any one of up to eight cards, except that you may not make a move that would take you over an edge.
From a Joker you move to any card from which you could legally have reached it. (Including the one you last moved from.)


Swapping two cards
On your turn to play, you may swap one of the Jokers for any other card in the same row or column.
Neither of these cards may be occupied, neither may be one of the cards involved in the most recently performed swap, and neither may be a Queen.

Winning
To win, you must reach your Juliet on an exact number of moves. That is, if moving from a numeral card you must take the full value of your move. 
You may, of course, reach her from a King or a Jack if possible.
